# HackerooOVRMenu
A exploit menu for Opposer VR - Roblox.

Yeah, this is likely the first dedicated menu (that is public) that exists right now.

To install this menu onto your executor, just put a .txt file in your executor's script folder containing:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackerooMan/HackerooOVRMenu/main/Code%20Stuffs",true))()
```
